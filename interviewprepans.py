I enjoy working in a team or a group and I feel my collaborative nature is my biggest strength. During every single academic project, I worked side-by-side with every member involved to achieve the target. By nature, I am an empathetic person and I can relate to people and understand their needs easily. Also, I work well under pressure and I have never missed a deadline in my academic years.

My weakness is that I can be overly critical of myself. On completing a project, I always have a feeling that it could have been done in a better way. This happens even after I receive a positive response which leads me to overwork and often I am left feeling burned out.
